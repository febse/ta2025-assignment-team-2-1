        "The first code cell below loads a subset of 5000 movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative. The task here is to compare the performance of different text classification methods on this dataset.\n",

        "Train a classifier of your choice (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, decision tree) using only the review text to create features. Evaluate the classifier using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score when predicting the sentiment labels.\n",

        "- Use TF-IDF vectorization as one of the feature extraction methods with varying n-gram ranges (e.g., unigrams, bigrams).\n",
        "- Compare the results with using a lower-dimensional representation of the text data using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the TF-IDF matrix.\n",
        "- Experiment with word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to represent the text data and train a classifier on these embeddings (by using the average of word vectors for each review to create a document-level representation).\n",
        "- Finally, use the document embeddings of two different LLMs available via OpenAI API (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002 and text-embedding-3-small) to represent the reviews and train classifiers on these embeddings.\n",

The story spans most conceivable aspects and unlike some documentaries did not try and refrain from showing the grimmer sides of the stories, as also dealing with the guilt of the people Don left behind him, wondering why they didn't stop him in time.

              "\"I really liked this Summerslam due to the look of the arena, the curtains and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason. Anyways, this could have been one of the best Summerslam's ever if the WWF didn't have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, now for it's time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man but I'm glad times have changed. It was a terrible main event just like every match Luger is in is terrible. Other matches on the card were Razor Ramon vs Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs Curt Hening, this was the event where Shawn named his big monster of a body guard Diesel, IRS vs 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart first takes on Doink then takes on Jerry Lawler and stuff with the Harts and Lawler was always very interesting, then Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty, Undertaker took on Giant Gonzalez in another terrible match, The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka took on Bam Bam Bigelow and the Headshrinkers, and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger this match was boring and it has a terrible ending.
